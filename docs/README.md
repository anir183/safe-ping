# SafePing

A secure workspace and chat application built with Python. The frontend uses Flet (a Flutter-based UI framework for Python) and the backend is a FastAPI WebSocket server.

## Architecture

### Frontend — Flet Python App (`frontend/`)

A reactive single-page application organized in layers:

- **State layer** — Three observable state classes (`UserState`, `ThemeState`, `RoomState`) drive the entire UI. Fields are decorated with `@ft.observable` so any change automatically propagates to dependent components.
- **Context layer** — Three Flet contexts (`UserContext`, `ThemeContext`, `RoomContext`) bridge state to the component tree. Components read context values via `ft.use_context()` and re-render when values change.
- **Pages** — `LoginPage` (select a user profile) gates entry to `AppPage` (the main workspace). Routing is purely context-based — the `Router` component checks `UserContext` to decide which page to render.
- **Workspace** — Once inside `AppPage`, a `RoomContext` drives the entire workspace. It tracks the active room, the open section (Chat / Whiteboard / Notes), and the full room list. Components like `ChatPage`, `WhiteboardPage`, and `NotesPage` each check `room_context.open_section` — if it doesn't match, they return an invisible `Empty()` control. This is how sections are toggled without URL-based routing.
- **Responsive layout** — The app adapts to four breakpoints (SM ≤700px, MD ≤1200px, LG ≤2000px, XL >2000px). `RoomPane` automatically switches between a compact nav rail, an expanded drawer, and a full three-panel layout (nav + content + info sidebar).
- **Repository pattern** — Abstract interfaces (`RoomsRepository`, `MessagesRepository`, `NotesRepository`, `WhiteboardRepository`, `UserRepository`) are backed by mock implementations. These are designed to be swapped for real API calls.
- **Services** — `WsConnection` manages WebSocket lifecycle (connect, reconnect, init-history, message events). `SharedPrefs` persists preferences via Flet's native key-value store.

### Backend — FastAPI Server (`backend/`)

A lightweight FastAPI server with a single WebSocket endpoint:

- `GET /` — Health check
- `WebSocket /ws/{room_id}?user_id=...` — Real-time messaging per room
- `ConnectionManager` — Tracks connected clients per room, stores message history in-memory, broadcasts messages to all peers (excluding the sender), and validates `sender_id` on each message.

## Security

- Messages are encrypted client-side before transmission using a PBKDF2-derived key with an HMAC-based stream cipher. The server receives already-encrypted payloads.
- The backend verifies that `sender_id` matches the authenticated `user_id` query parameter, rejecting mismatched messages.
- A shared passphrase (`safe-ping-demo-2026`) is used for the demo; in production this would be replaced with per-user key exchange.

## Features

- **Multi-room chat** — Real-time messaging with WebSocket transport and message history
- **Collaborative notes** — Per-room rich text notes with save/load
- **Whiteboard** — Freehand drawing with brush size and color controls, persists strokes per room
- **Dashboard** — Landing view when no room is selected
- **Theme system** — Light/dark mode with distinct color seeds (Lime for dark, Purple for light), persisted across sessions
- **Responsive design** — Adapts layout across desktop, tablet, and mobile viewports
- **User profiles** — Select from mock users to enter the workspace; each user has name, email, and avatar
